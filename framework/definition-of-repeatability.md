# Definition of Repeatability

Repeatability is different than early traction.

Repeatability means:

1. Access is systematic  
   The team knows how to reliably reach the defined ideal customer profile (ICP) through specific channels.

2. Positioning converts consistently  
   Messaging and framing produce stable conversion rates across similar prospects.

3. Execution is transferable  
   A non-founder can run the motion with comparable results.

4. Unit economics hold  
   CAC and sales cycle remain viable when real labor cost is included.

If any one of these fails, the motion is not repeatable.

Repeatability must be validated before scaling headcount or spend.
