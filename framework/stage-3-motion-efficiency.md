# Stage 3: Motion Efficiency

Objective: Strengthen economic durability and conversion efficiency before scaling headcount.

Stage 3 assumes repeatability has been validated.

The goal is not more revenue.
The goal is stronger unit economics and operational leverage.

## Phase 1: Funnel Optimization

Analyze:
- Conversion rates by stage
- Drop-off points
- Sales cycle length
- Qualification filters

Actions:
- Improve qualification discipline
- Refine messaging sequencing
- Tighten pipeline hygiene

Deliverable:
- Improved stage-by-stage conversion baseline
- Reduced variability in close rates

---

## Phase 2: Channel Efficiency

Analyze:
- CAC by channel
- Meeting-to-close rate by channel
- Sales cycle by channel

Actions:
- Reduce spend on underperforming channels
- Double down on highest-efficiency segments
- Improve targeting precision

Deliverable:
- Reduced blended CAC
- Channel prioritization model

---

## Phase 3: Economic Validation

Test:
- CAC including fully-loaded labor cost
- Payback period
- Contribution margin durability
- Sensitivity to pricing changes

Deliverable:
- Fully-loaded CAC model
- Confirmed payback threshold
- Unit economics stress test

---

## Phase 4: Process Compression

Improve:
- Time to first meeting
- Time to proposal
- Time to close

Deliverable:
- Reduced sales cycle length
- More predictable forecasting window

---

## Stage 3 Exit Criteria

- CAC reduced ≥20% from initial baseline
- Sales cycle reduced ≥20–25%
- Unit economics hold under fully-loaded labor cost
- Performance variance narrowed across operators
