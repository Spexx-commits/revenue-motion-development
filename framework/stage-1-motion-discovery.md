# Stage 1: Motion Discovery

Objective: Identify the components required for a repeatable revenue motion.

Stage 1 is not about generating more revenue.
It is about understanding why revenue happens.

This stage tests the first two dimensions of repeatability:

1. Access  
   Can we systematically reach the defined ICP through specific channels?

2. Positioning  
   Does consistent messaging produce stable conversion across similar prospects?

Key Questions:
- Who is our true ICP based on revenue concentration?
- Which channels produce qualified meetings reliably?
- What messaging converts and why?
- Where is the founder compensating with intuition or credibility?

Deliverables:
- Defined primary ICP
- 2–3 tested channels with documented data
- Documented sales narrative
- Conversion baseline by segment
- Preliminary CAC estimate

Exit Criteria:
Evidence that access and positioning are not dependent on founder improvisation.
