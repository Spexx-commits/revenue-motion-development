# Revenue Motion Development: Complete Stage Progression Summary

Revenue Motion Development is a staged framework for transitioning from founder-led sales to scalable revenue.

It distinguishes traction from repeatability.

The goal is not to grow faster.
The goal is to grow deliberately.

# Stage 1: Motion Discovery  
Extract Hypotheses

Objective:
Document the existing founder-led revenue motion and define explicit hypotheses.

Focus:
- Revenue concentration analysis
- ICP hypothesis development
- Acquisition path documentation
- Founder sales narrative extraction

Output:
- Defined Primary ICP
- Secondary ICP (if viable)
- Disqualification criteria
- Channel hypothesis list
- Documented sales flow

Gate to Stage 2:
Founder-led motion is fully documented and assumptions are explicit.

# Stage 2: Motion Validation  
Validate Repeatability

Objective:
Test whether the defined ICP and channels produce predictable results without founder dependence.

Focus:
- ICP-targeted outreach testing
- Channel reliability experiments
- Messaging consistency validation
- Founder vs operator performance comparison

Output:
- Conversion baseline by ICP
- Tiered channel assessment
- Performance variance measurement
- Early fully-loaded CAC estimate

Gate to Stage 3:
- Primary ICP clearly outperforms alternatives
- At least one channel produces predictable access
- Non-founder achieves ≥70–80% of founder baseline
- Economics appear viable

# Stage 3: Motion Efficiency  
Strengthen Economics

Objective:
Improve economic durability and reduce variance before scaling.

Focus:
- Funnel drop-off optimization
- Fully-loaded CAC modeling
- Sales cycle compression
- Channel economics comparison

Output:
- Reduced CAC
- Reduced sales cycle
- Narrowed conversion variance
- Clear Tier 1 channel
- Confirmed payback model

Gate to Stage 4:
- Fully-loaded CAC viable
- Sales cycle stable
- Tier 1 channel identified
- Economic model stress-tested

---

# Stage 4: Scale Readiness  
Commit & Scale

Objective:
Make explicit strategic decisions and build infrastructure for scale.

Focus:
- ICP strategy (single vs multi-segment)
- Channel scaling plan
- Organizational design
- Playbooks and onboarding
- 12-month scale modeling

Output:
- Written ICP strategy
- Tiered channel allocation plan
- Hiring profiles and org design
- Playbooks and forecasting system
- Go/No-Go hiring decision

Scale only after infrastructure matches validated motion.

# Core Principle

Early traction is not proof of repeatability.

Repeatability requires:

- Systematic access to ICP
- Stable positioning
- Transferable execution
- Durable unit economics

The stages enforce sequencing discipline.

Discovery before validation.
Validation before optimization.
Optimization before scale.
