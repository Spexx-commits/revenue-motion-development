# Stage 2: Motion Validation

Objective: Validate that the documented motion from Stage 1 is repeatable without founder dependence.

Stage 2 tests the hypotheses extracted in Stage 1.

It shifts from documentation to controlled validation.

---

## Phase 1: ICP Validation

Test:
- Does the defined ICP consistently convert?
- Are disqualifiers accurate?
- Does revenue concentration hold when targeted intentionally?

Deliverable:
- Conversion data by ICP segment
- Confirmed primary ICP
- Eliminated false-positive segments

---

## Phase 2: Acquisition Validation

Test:
- Do the documented channels produce qualified meetings reliably?
- Are response and meeting rates stable?
- Does performance degrade without founder involvement?

Deliverable:
- Channel performance baseline
- Cost per meeting by channel
- Evidence of systematic access

---

## Phase 3: Positioning Validation

Test:
- Does the documented narrative convert consistently?
- Are objection patterns predictable?
- Does messaging hold across similar prospects?

Deliverable:
- Stable conversion baseline
- Refined positioning framework
- Updated objection library

---

## Phase 4: Transferability Validation

Test:
- Can a non-founder execute the motion with comparable results?
- Where does performance degrade?
- Is the founder compensating for structural gaps?

Deliverable:
- Founder vs operator performance comparison
- Identified transfer gaps
- Adjusted playbooks

---

## Stage 2 Exit Criteria

- ICP consistently converts
- Channels produce predictable access
- Messaging produces stable conversion
- Non-founder execution achieves ≥70–80% of founder baseline
