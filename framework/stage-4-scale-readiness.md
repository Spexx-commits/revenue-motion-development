# Stage 4: Scale Readiness

Objective: Make explicit strategic choices and build the infrastructure required to scale a validated revenue motion.

Stage 4 is not discovery.
It is commitment.

The motion has been validated and optimized.
Now leadership must decide how to scale it deliberately.

## Phase 1: Strategic Decisions

### ICP Strategy

Choose between:

**Primary ICP Focus**
Concentrate all resources on the highest-performing segment.
Appropriate when:
- Primary ICP economics significantly outperform others
- Growth targets can be met through focused scaling
- Organizational simplicity is prioritized

**Multi-ICP Strategy**
Maintain multiple ICP segments with separate processes or teams.
Appropriate when:
- Secondary segments have acceptable economics
- Aggregate volume is required for growth targets
- Channel constraints differ by segment

Decision Criteria:
- Unit economics by segment
- Skill requirements by segment
- Channel capacity constraints
- Organizational complexity tradeoffs

---

### Channel Strategy

Classify channels:

**Tier 1 — Scale Aggressively**
Best-performing channels for target ICP(s)

**Tier 2 — Maintain Opportunistically**
Channels that work but do not justify aggressive investment

**Tier 3 — Eliminate**
Channels that remained weak through optimization

Deliverable:
- Tiered channel map by ICP
- Clear resource allocation plan

---

## Phase 2: Organizational Design

Design for scale based on validated data.

Key Questions:
- How many operators can each channel support?
- Do ICPs require separate teams?
- When is specialization required (SDR vs AE)?
- What capabilities should the first sales leader bring?

Deliverable:
- Organizational structure plan
- Hiring profiles
- Span-of-control assumptions

---

## Phase 3: Infrastructure & Playbooks

Build systems that support scale:

- Complete playbooks by ICP
- Training & onboarding programs (30/60/90 day plans)
- CRM configuration and reporting dashboards
- Forecasting methodology
- Compensation design aligned with validated metrics

Deliverable:
- Scalable operating model documentation

---

## Phase 4: Scale Modeling

Model scale deliberately.

- 12-month hiring plan based on validated ramp times
- Pipeline coverage modeling
- Capital efficiency projections
- Sensitivity analysis

Deliverable:
- Scale plan with stress-tested assumptions

---

## Common Pitfalls

- Perfectionism paralysis
- Premature scaling
- Over-optimizing strong areas while ignoring leaks
- ICP confusion
- Sample size errors
- Ignoring operator feedback

---

## Stage 4 Exit Criteria

- Explicit ICP strategy selected
- Channel tiers defined
- Organizational design documented
- Playbooks complete
- Infrastructure in place
- Leadership role clearly defined as scaling a proven motion
