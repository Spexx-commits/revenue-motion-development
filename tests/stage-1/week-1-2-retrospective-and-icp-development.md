# Week 1–2: Retrospective Analysis & ICP Development

Stage: Motion Discovery  
Owner: Founder  
Time Required: 1–2 weeks  
Minimum Sample Size: All existing customers

---

## Objective

Understand how existing customers were actually acquired and develop a preliminary ICP hypothesis.

This is not guesswork.
This is structured pattern analysis.

---

# Part 1: Customer Acquisition Inventory

Create a spreadsheet documenting every customer.

Minimum columns:

- Customer Name
- Acquisition Source
- Contact Method
- Sales Cycle (days)
- Deal Size
- Industry
- Company Size
- Pain Point Acuity (1–10, founder assessment)
- Budget Authority Level

Do not skip this step.
You are extracting reality from memory.

# Part 2: Pattern Identification

Group customers by:

### Company Size
- <100 employees
- 100–250 employees
- 250–500 employees
- 500+ employees

Track:
- Average deal size
- Average sales cycle
- Close rate (if available)

### Industry
Track:
- # of customers
- Avg deal size
- Avg sales cycle

### Pain Point Acuity
Group into:
- High (9–10)
- Medium (6–8)
- Low (1–5)

Track:
- Close rate
- Sales cycle length

### Acquisition Source
Group into:
- Founder network
- Conference
- Cold outbound
- Inbound

Track:
- % of total customers
- Relative quality
- Scalability potential

# Part 3: Preliminary ICP Development

Based on patterns, define:

## Primary ICP Hypothesis

- Industry:
- Company Size:
- Revenue Range:
- Pain Profile:
- Buyer Title:
- Buying Process:
- Budget Range:
- Decision Timeline:

Write a rationale:
Why this segment over others?

---

## Secondary ICP Hypothesis

Define only if economics are acceptable.

---

## Disqualification Criteria (Preliminary)

Explicitly define who NOT to pursue.

Examples:
- Company size too small
- Pain <6/10
- No budget authority

---

# Part 4: Initial Channel Assessment

For each channel:

- % of total customers
- Conversion quality
- Scalability risk
- Founder dependence level

Classify:
- Likely scalable
- Episodic
- Network-dependent
- High-potential but unproven

---

# Deliverables

By end of Week 2:

- Completed customer acquisition spreadsheet
- Documented Primary ICP hypothesis
- Documented Secondary ICP (if viable)
- Explicit disqualification criteria
- Channel assessment with testing priorities
- Written hypotheses for Stage 2 validation
