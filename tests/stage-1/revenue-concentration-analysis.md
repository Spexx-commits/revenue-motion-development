# Revenue Concentration Analysis

Stage: Motion Discovery  
Owner: Founder  
Time Required: 2–3 hours  
Minimum Sample Size: All existing customers

---

## Why This Test Matters

Most founders believe they serve multiple segments equally.
In reality, revenue is usually concentrated in a small, definable segment.
If you cannot identify revenue concentration, you likely do not have a clear ICP.

---

## Hypothesis

If a repeatable motion exists, 50%+ of revenue will cluster in a definable segment.

## How to Run This Test

Step 1: Export all customers and revenue data.

Step 2: Segment customers by:
- Industry
- Company size
- Use case
- Deal size
- Acquisition source

Step 3: Rank segments by total revenue.

Step 4: Identify the top-performing segment.

---

## What to Track

- % of total revenue by segment
- Average deal size by segment
- Retention by segment
- Sales cycle by segment

---

## What “Good” Looks Like

- One segment represents ≥40–60% of revenue
- Segment characteristics are clearly definable
- Deal size and retention are stronger in that segment

---

## What Failure Looks Like

- Revenue evenly distributed across unrelated segments
- No identifiable clustering
- High variance in deal size and retention

---

## Common Founder Mistakes

- Defining ICP too broadly
- Ignoring retention and focusing only on revenue
- Using small sample sizes to overfit a segment
