# Founder Sales Process Deconstruction

Stage: Motion Discovery  
Owner: Founder  
Time Required: 1–2 days  
Minimum Sample Size: 10 recent deals (won or lost)

---

## Objective

Extract the implicit sales process and positioning logic currently residing in the founder’s head.

Most early-stage sales rely on instinct.
This test makes it explicit.

---

## Why This Matters

Without documenting:

- Narrative structure
- Qualification criteria
- Objection handling
- Buying triggers

Stage 2 validation becomes inconsistent.

---

## Setup

Select:

- 5 recently won deals
- 5 recently lost deals

Review:

- Email threads
- Call notes
- Memory of conversations

---

## Document

For each deal:

- How was the problem framed?
- What triggered urgency?
- Who drove the decision?
- What objections appeared?
- What caused loss (if lost)?

Then answer:

- What do I always say in the first call?
- What questions do I consistently ask?
- When do I disqualify?
- When do deals stall?

---

## Deliverable

Produce:

- Step-by-step sales flow outline
- List of recurring objections
- Qualification checklist
- “Red flags” list
- Typical buying process map

---

## What “Good” Looks Like

- Clear repeating patterns
- Defined qualification questions
- Consistent narrative arc
- Predictable stall points

---

## What Failure Looks Like

- Every deal feels unique
- No repeatable flow
- Founder relies on improvisation
- No explicit qualification discipline

---

## Common Founder Mistakes

- Romanticizing wins
- Ignoring lost deal patterns
- Overestimating personal skill vs structural clarity
