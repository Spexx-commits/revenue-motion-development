# Experiment 3: Sales Cycle Compression

Stage: Motion Efficiency  
Owner: Founder  
Time Required: 2–3 weeks  
Minimum Sample Size: 20+ opportunities  

---

## Objective

Reduce time from first contact to close.

Shorter cycles improve capital efficiency and predictability.

---

## Why This Matters

Long cycles:

- Increase CAC
- Increase uncertainty
- Reduce capital velocity

---

## Setup

Measure:

- Average days from first contact to close
- Stage-by-stage duration
- Delay causes (legal, budget, qualification, etc.)

Then implement:

- Stronger qualification filters
- Clear next-step discipline
- Structured follow-up cadence
- Defined timeline expectations in early calls

---

## Track

- Average cycle length
- Variance in cycle length
- Close rate impact

---

## What “Good” Looks Like

- 15–25% reduction in cycle length
- Reduced variance between deals
- No decline in close rate

---

## What Failure Looks Like

- Faster cycles but worse close rate
- Qualification loosened to “speed things up”
- No measurable change

---

## Interpretation

Cycle compression should improve economics without harming quality.
