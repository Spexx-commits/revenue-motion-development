# Week 7–10: Motion Efficiency Sprint

Stage: Motion Efficiency  
Owner: Founder  
Duration: 4 Weeks  
Objective: Strengthen economic durability and reduce variance before scaling.

Stage 3 is about efficiency, not growth.

You are improving:
- Conversion
- CAC
- Sales cycle
- Predictability

Do not add new channels.
Do not expand ICP.
Do not increase headcount.

Tighten the motion you validated.

# Overview

During this sprint you will:

1. Identify funnel leaks
2. Model fully-loaded CAC
3. Compress sales cycle
4. Rank channel economics

The goal is not perfection.
The goal is “strong enough to deserve scale.”

# Week 7: Funnel Leak Identification

Run:
- Funnel Drop-Off Analysis

Focus on:
- Largest % conversion loss
- Longest stage delay
- Highest variance stage

Deliverable:
- Identified primary optimization target
- Before/after funnel baseline

---

# Week 8: Fully-Loaded CAC Modeling

Run:
- Fully-Loaded CAC Model

Calculate:
- CAC by channel
- CAC by ICP
- Payback period
- Gross margin contribution

Deliverable:
- Clear CAC model
- Channel cost comparison
- Economic viability assessment

---

# Week 9: Sales Cycle Compression

Run:
- Sales Cycle Compression Experiment

Focus on:
- Qualification tightening
- Stage progression discipline
- Timeline clarity in early calls

Deliverable:
- Reduced average cycle length
- Reduced variance

---

# Week 10: Channel Economics Ranking

Run:
- Channel Economics Comparison

Classify:

Tier 1 – Scale aggressively  
Tier 2 – Maintain  
Tier 3 – Eliminate  

Deliverable:
- Ranked channel list
- Scale readiness assessment

---

# Exit Criteria

You may proceed to Stage 4 only if:

- Fully-loaded CAC is viable
- Payback period is acceptable
- Sales cycle reduced or stabilized
- Conversion variance narrowed
- At least one Tier 1 channel clearly identified

If not, repeat Stage 3 optimization before scaling.
