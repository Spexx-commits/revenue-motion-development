# Experiment 1: Funnel Drop-Off Analysis

Stage: Motion Efficiency  
Owner: Founder  
Time Required: 1 week  
Minimum Sample Size: 50+ prospects through full funnel  

---

## Objective

Identify where efficiency is lost in the sales funnel.

Stage 3 is not about generating more top-of-funnel.
It is about tightening conversion.

---

## Why This Matters

Most founders try to scale volume before fixing leaks.

Small improvements in conversion often outperform increased lead volume.

---

## Setup

Map your funnel stages clearly:

Example:

1. Prospect Contacted
2. Response
3. Meeting Booked
4. Qualified
5. Proposal Sent
6. Closed Won

Export last 50+ prospects and track progression.

---

## Track

- Conversion rate between each stage
- Average days between stages
- Variance by ICP
- Variance by channel

---

## What “Good” Looks Like

- Clear identification of largest drop-off
- Conversion variance narrowing
- No unexplained stage volatility

---

## What Failure Looks Like

- Major drop-offs unexamined
- Conversion swings wildly week-to-week
- Qualification inconsistent

---

## Interpretation

Focus optimization on:

- Largest percentage drop-off
- Longest delay stage
- Most inconsistent stage

Do not optimize already-strong stages.

---

## Common Founder Mistakes

- Obsessing over top-of-funnel
- Ignoring qualification discipline
- Adding new channels instead of fixing leaks
- Changing multiple variables at once
