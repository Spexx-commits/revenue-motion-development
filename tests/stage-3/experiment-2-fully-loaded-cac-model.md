# Experiment 2: Fully-Loaded CAC Model

Stage: Motion Efficiency  
Owner: Founder  
Time Required: 1–2 days  
Minimum Sample Size: 1 full sales cycle of data  

---

## Objective

Calculate true Customer Acquisition Cost including labor.

Repeatability without economic viability is not scale-ready.

---

## Why This Matters

Many founders calculate CAC using only ad spend.

If you exclude labor cost, your economics are fictional.

---

## Setup

Calculate:

1. Total spend per channel (ads, tools, etc.)
2. Sales labor cost (fully loaded salary + benefits)
3. Marketing labor cost (if applicable)

Then compute:

Fully-Loaded CAC =  
(Total Channel Spend + Allocated Labor Cost) ÷ New Customers Acquired

---

## Track

- CAC by channel
- CAC by ICP
- Average deal size
- Gross margin
- Payback period (months)

---

## What “Good” Looks Like

- Payback period ≤ 12 months (context dependent)
- Healthy gross margin after CAC
- Primary ICP CAC lower than secondary segments

---

## What Failure Looks Like

- CAC > first-year revenue
- Payback period too long
- Channel viability dependent on underpriced founder labor

---

## Interpretation

If CAC is too high:

- Improve conversion
- Narrow ICP
- Reduce sales cycle
- Eliminate weak channels

Do not scale until economics make sense.
