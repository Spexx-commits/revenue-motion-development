# Experiment 4: Channel Economics Comparison

Stage: Motion Efficiency  
Owner: Founder  
Time Required: 1 week  
Minimum Sample Size: 2+ channels with 30+ prospects each  

---

## Objective

Determine which channels deserve aggressive scaling.

Not all working channels are equal.

---

## Setup

For each validated channel, calculate:

- Fully-loaded CAC
- Average deal size
- Sales cycle length
- Close rate
- Gross margin contribution

Rank channels by:

1. CAC efficiency
2. Speed
3. Predictability

---

## Track

- CAC by channel
- Contribution margin
- Conversion stability
- Capital efficiency

---

## What “Good” Looks Like

- Clear Tier 1 channel
- Tier 2 channels that are viable but secondary
- Tier 3 channels eliminated

---

## What Failure Looks Like

- Channel economics unclear
- Scaling based on anecdotal wins
- Ignoring labor intensity differences

---

## Interpretation

Only scale Tier 1 channels in Stage 4.
