# Experiment 3: Messaging Consistency Test

Stage: Motion Validation  
Owner: Founder  
Time Required: 1 week  
Minimum Sample Size: 30–50 ICP conversations  

---

## Objective

Determine whether your positioning produces stable conversion patterns across similar prospects.

Repeatability requires messaging consistency.

---

## Hypothesis

If positioning is correct:

- Objections repeat
- Qualification patterns stabilize
- Conversion rates narrow within a defined range

---

## Setup

- Use a consistent narrative for all outreach and calls.
- Log objections verbatim.
- Track qualification criteria strictly.
- Do not improvise positioning mid-test.

---

## Track

- Objection frequency
- Close rate variance
- Meeting-to-close conversion
- Sales cycle length

---

## What “Good” Looks Like

- Objections cluster into predictable themes
- Conversion variance within ±20%
- Similar ICPs respond similarly

---

## What Failure Looks Like

- Every deal feels different
- Objections vary wildly
- Conversion swings dramatically

---

## Interpretation

Stable messaging = foundation for playbooks.

Unstable messaging = return to ICP refinement.

---

## Common Founder Mistakes

- Changing messaging mid-test
- Over-customizing to individual prospects
- Ignoring repeated objections
- Confusing charisma with clarity
