# Experiment 2: Channel Reliability Test

Stage: Motion Validation  
Owner: Founder  
Time Required: 1–2 weeks  
Minimum Sample Size: 30–50 prospects per channel tested  

---

## Objective

Determine which acquisition channels produce predictable access to your Primary ICP.

Repeatability requires at least one reliable channel.

---

## Hypothesis

If a channel is viable for scale:

- It produces consistent meeting rates
- Conversion variance is narrow
- Cost per meeting is economically viable

---

## Setup

Select at least two channels to test:

- Cold outbound
- LinkedIn outreach
- Conference follow-up
- Inbound lead follow-up

For each channel:
- Use identical ICP targeting criteria
- Use consistent messaging
- Track performance separately

---

## Track

- Response rate
- Meeting rate
- Qualified meeting rate
- Cost per meeting
- Time to first response

---

## What “Good” Looks Like

- ≥5–10% meeting rate (context dependent)
- Predictable performance across 30+ prospects
- Cost per meeting supports your unit economics

---

## What Failure Looks Like

- Wide performance swings
- Performance dependent on founder effort
- Cost per meeting unsustainable at scale

---

## Interpretation

Tier channels:

Tier 1 – Predictable & scalable  
Tier 2 – Works but episodic  
Tier 3 – Inconsistent or weak  

Proceed to Stage 3 only with at least one Tier 1 channel.

---

## Common Founder Mistakes

- Declaring a channel “dead” after 10 attempts
- Not controlling for ICP consistency
- Comparing warm and cold channels unfairly
- Ignoring cost structure
