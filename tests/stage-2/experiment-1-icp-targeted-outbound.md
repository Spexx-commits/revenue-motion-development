# Experiment 1: ICP-Targeted Outbound Test

Stage: Motion Validation  
Owner: Founder  
Time Required: 2 weeks  
Minimum Sample Size: 100 Primary ICP prospects + 100 Secondary/Adjacent prospects  

---

## Objective

Determine whether your defined Primary ICP converts materially better than adjacent segments.

This test validates whether your ICP hypothesis from Stage 1 holds under structured outreach.

---

## Hypothesis

If your Primary ICP is correct:

- Response rate will be ≥2x higher than secondary segments
- Meeting rate will be higher
- Sales cycle will begin faster

---

## Setup

1. Build a list of 100 prospects matching your Primary ICP.
2. Build a list of 100 prospects in a Secondary or adjacent segment.
3. Use consistent outreach messaging across both groups.
4. Optional: Split each group into two messaging variants (problem-focused vs solution-focused).

---

## Track

- Response rate
- Meeting rate
- Qualified meeting rate
- Early pipeline progression
- Estimated cost per meeting

---

## What “Good” Looks Like

- Primary ICP clearly outperforms secondary segment
- Conversion rates show meaningful separation
- Messaging patterns begin stabilizing

---

## What Failure Looks Like

- Similar performance across segments
- Secondary ICP performs equally or better
- No clear signal emerges after 200 attempts

---

## Interpretation

If Primary ICP clearly outperforms:
→ Double down in Stage 2.

If results are similar:
→ ICP may be too broad or misdefined.

If Secondary outperforms:
→ Re-evaluate Stage 1 segmentation.

---

## Common Founder Mistakes

- Using too small a sample size
- Changing messaging mid-test
- Comparing segments with different quality lists
- Stopping after a few positive responses
