# Experiment 4: Founder vs Operator Validation

Stage: Motion Validation  
Owner: Founder  
Time Required: 1–2 weeks  
Minimum Sample Size: 10–15 meetings or deals handled by non-founder  

---

## Objective

Determine whether the motion can be executed without founder dependence.

Repeatability requires transferability.

---

## Hypothesis

If the motion is repeatable:

- Non-founder performance reaches ≥70–80% of founder baseline
- Objection handling follows documented patterns
- Conversion remains economically viable

---

## Setup

Provide operator with:

- Defined Primary ICP
- Messaging narrative
- Qualification criteria
- Sales process documentation

Assign real meetings or deals.
Do not intervene unless necessary.

---

## Track

- Meeting-to-close rate
- Sales cycle length
- Objection resolution rate
- Performance delta vs founder

---

## What “Good” Looks Like

- Performance within 70–80% of founder
- Similar objection patterns
- Stable qualification outcomes

---

## What Failure Looks Like

- Significant performance collapse
- Operator confusion
- Founder rescuing deals

---

## Interpretation

If operator struggles:
→ Documentation incomplete  
→ ICP unstable  
→ Messaging unclear  

Do not scale until this gap narrows.

---

## Common Founder Mistakes

- Hovering and interfering
- Assigning weak prospects
- Blaming the operator prematurely
- Ignoring structural flaws
