# Week 3–6: Motion Validation Sprint

Stage: Motion Validation  
Owner: Founder  
Duration: 4 weeks  
Objective: Validate that the documented motion from Stage 1 is repeatable without founder dependence.

Stage 2 tests whether your motion can survive structure.

---

# Overview

During this sprint, you will test:

1. ICP validity
2. Channel reliability
3. Messaging consistency
4. Founder vs operator transferability

You are no longer documenting.
You are validating.

# Week 3–4: ICP & Channel Validation

## Required Tests

- ICP-Targeted Outbound Test
- Channel Reliability Test

## Minimum Sample Size

- 30–50 targeted outreach attempts per ICP
- 30+ prospects per channel tested

## Goal

Determine whether:
- Your defined ICP converts consistently
- Channels produce predictable access

Deliverable:
- Conversion baseline by ICP
- Channel performance comparison
- Early CAC estimate

---

# Week 5: Messaging Consistency

## Required Test

- Messaging Consistency Test

## Goal

Determine whether:
- Similar prospects respond similarly
- Objection patterns are predictable
- Close rates stabilize

Deliverable:
- Updated narrative
- Conversion variance analysis

---

# Week 6: Founder vs Operator Validation

## Required Test

- Founder vs Operator Performance Test

Minimum:
- 10–15 meetings or deals handled by non-founder

Goal:
- Determine performance delta
- Identify structural gaps in playbook

Deliverable:
- Performance comparison
- Transfer gap analysis

---

# Exit Criteria

You may proceed to Stage 3 only if:

- ICP conversion rates are stable (±20% variance)
- At least one channel produces predictable access
- Non-founder achieves ≥70–80% of founder baseline
- Fully-loaded CAC remains viable

If these conditions are not met, return to Stage 1 refinement.
