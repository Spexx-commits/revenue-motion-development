# Week 3–6: Demand Generation Experiments with ICP

Stage: Motion Validation  
Owner: Founder  
Duration: 4 Weeks  
Objective: Validate that the defined ICP and acquisition channels produce repeatable results under controlled testing.

Stage 2 is where hypotheses become evidence.

You are deliberately testing whether your motion works.

---

# Overview

During this sprint you will:

1. Validate Primary ICP performance
2. Compare Primary vs Secondary ICP economics
3. Test channel reliability
4. Measure messaging consistency
5. Test early transferability

You must run structured experiments with minimum sample sizes before drawing conclusions.

# Week 3–4: ICP-Targeted Outbound Experiment

## Objective

Test whether your Primary ICP converts more reliably than other segments.

## Setup

Build a list of:

- 100 Primary ICP prospects
- 100 Secondary or adjacent segment prospects

Use consistent messaging structure across both.

Optional: Split each segment into two messaging variants (problem-focused vs solution-focused).

## Minimum Sample Size

- 100 outreach attempts per segment
- At least 30–50 meaningful responses before interpreting results

## Track

- Response rate
- Meeting rate
- Qualified meeting rate
- Sales cycle speed (if deals progress)
- Early CAC estimate

## What “Good” Looks Like

- Primary ICP response rate ≥ 2x non-primary segment
- Higher meeting-to-qualified conversion
- Faster progression in pipeline

If results are similar across segments, your ICP may be too broad.

# Week 5: Channel Reliability Test

## Objective

Determine which channels produce predictable access to your ICP.

Test at least two channels:

- Cold outbound
- LinkedIn outreach
- Conference follow-up
- Inbound content (if available)

## Minimum Sample Size

- 30–50 prospects per channel
- Consistent targeting criteria

## Track

- Response rate
- Meeting rate
- Cost per meeting
- Time to first response

## Deliverable

Rank channels:

Tier 1 – Predictable and scalable  
Tier 2 – Works but episodic  
Tier 3 – Low signal or inconsistent

# Week 5–6: Messaging Consistency Test

## Objective

Determine whether your positioning produces stable conversion across similar prospects.

## Method

- Use consistent narrative across outreach
- Log objections and buying triggers
- Track conversion variance

## What to Evaluate

- Are objections repeating?
- Is close rate stabilizing?
- Is qualification predictable?

If conversion varies wildly, positioning is unstable.

# Week 6: Founder vs Operator Validation

## Objective

Test whether the motion can survive beyond founder execution.

## Setup

Assign:

- 10–15 meetings or deals to a non-founder operator

Provide:

- ICP definition
- Messaging narrative
- Qualification criteria
- Sales flow documentation

## Track

- Meeting-to-close rate
- Objection handling success
- Sales cycle variance

## Threshold

Non-founder should achieve ≥70–80% of founder baseline performance.

If performance collapses, the motion is still founder-dependent.

---

# Exit Criteria

You may proceed to Stage 3 only if:

- Primary ICP clearly outperforms alternatives
- At least one channel produces predictable access
- Messaging variance narrows
- Non-founder performance approaches founder baseline
- Early CAC model supports scale

If these are not met, refine ICP or positioning and repeat.
