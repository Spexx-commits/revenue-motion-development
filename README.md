# Revenue Motion Development

> A stage-based system for transforming founder-led sales into scalable revenue infrastructure.

### A Framework for Post-PMF Go-to-Market Discovery


Most startups treat post-product-market-fit growth as an execution problem.

It is a discovery problem.

Revenue Motion Development is a structured, stage-based system for:

- Discovering a repeatable revenue motion
- Validating it without founder dependence
- Optimizing efficiency before scaling headcount
- Building infrastructure for confident scale

---

## Who This Is For

- Founders with early traction (10–50 customers)
- Teams transitioning from founder-led sales
- Startups preparing for Series A
- Companies unsure whether they have a repeatable motion

## Who This Is Not For

- Pre-product-market-fit startups still searching for demand
- Companies already running a mature, specialized revenue org
- Teams looking for quick tactical hacks instead of system design

## How to Use This Repository

This repository is structured as both a conceptual framework and a practical operating system.

If you are a founder:

1. Read Stage 1 (Motion Discovery).
2. Evaluate whether your revenue motion is truly repeatable.
3. Use the stage checklist to identify gaps.
4. Run structured experiments before hiring for scale.

If you are an operator:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Use the stage checklist as your execution roadmap.
3. Log all experiments in the /experiments directory.
4. Validate repeatability before recommending headcount expansion.

The goal is sequencing discipline — discovery before scale.

## The Four Stages

1. Motion Discovery  
2. Motion Validation  
3. Motion Efficiency  
4. Scale Readiness  

This repository contains both the conceptual framework and the practical operating system used to execute it.

If you're a founder with 10–50 customers considering hiring a VP Sales, start with Stage 1.
