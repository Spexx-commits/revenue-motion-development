# Revenue Motion Development

### A Framework for Post-PMF Go-to-Market Discovery

Most startups treat post-product-market-fit growth as an execution problem.

It is a discovery problem.

Revenue Motion Development is a structured, stage-based system for:

- Discovering a repeatable revenue motion
- Validating it without founder dependence
- Optimizing efficiency before scaling headcount
- Building infrastructure for confident scale

---

## The Four Stages

1. Motion Discovery  
2. Motion Validation  
3. Motion Efficiency  
4. Scale Readiness  

This repository contains both the conceptual framework and the practical operating system used to execute it.

If you're a founder with 10–50 customers considering hiring a VP Sales, start with Stage 1.
