# Revenue Motion Development

> A stage-based system for transforming founder-led sales into scalable revenue infrastructure.

### A Framework for Post-PMF Go-to-Market Discovery


Most startups treat post-product-market-fit growth as an execution problem.

It is a discovery problem.

Revenue Motion Development is a structured, stage-based system for:

- Discovering a repeatable revenue motion
- Validating it without founder dependence
- Optimizing efficiency before scaling headcount
- Building infrastructure for confident scale

---

## Who This Is For

- Founders with early traction (10–50 customers)
- Teams transitioning from founder-led sales
- Startups preparing for Series A
- Companies unsure whether they have a repeatable motion

## Who This Is Not For

- Pre-product-market-fit startups still searching for demand
- Companies already running a mature, specialized revenue org
- Teams looking for quick tactical hacks instead of system design

---

## The Four Stages

1. Motion Discovery  
2. Motion Validation  
3. Motion Efficiency  
4. Scale Readiness  

This repository contains both the conceptual framework and the practical operating system used to execute it.

If you're a founder with 10–50 customers considering hiring a VP Sales, start with Stage 1.
